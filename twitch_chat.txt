Woo, more C++ 
23:00:48ghassanpl
Is it weird that I write almost exactly the same way as you do? 
23:01:53ghassanpl
In almost every way, except the case of class field names O_o 
23:02:13
But I could very well mistake your code for mine 
23:03:05
I name private fields mLikeThis, and public members LikeThis 
23:03:27
So not far off 
23:05:22ghassanpl
I have my own "private" library of common functions/classes/algorithms though, targeted towards game making though :P 
23:05:48skynnnet32
how old are you? 
23:07:05skynnnet32
i am 18 
23:07:10dipolaar
so what's ur favorite c++111/14 feature for everydays programming? 
23:07:40ghassanpl
dipolaar, NSDMI ! 
23:07:50
Oh god NSDMI are the best things ever 
23:08:10
Also lambdas! And variadic templates! And auto! And decltype! And almost everything else! 
23:08:23skynnnet32
who do you work for? 
23:08:35dipolaar
variadic template here probably 
23:09:45ghassanpl
NSDMIs are the best thing ever, no more explicit constructors just for member initializer list ! 
23:10:46skynnnet32
what's the difference between C++ and C# ? 
23:10:51dipolaar
im not a fan of nsdmi 
23:10:55diukas1
@Skynnnet32 lewl 
23:11:06
you cant compare c++ and c# 
23:11:08skynnnet32
i am newb i k now 
23:11:13diukas1
it's too different languages 
23:11:20ghassanpl
dipolaar, why? 
23:11:31skynnnet32
why is one better than other? 
23:11:45ghassanpl
sKyNNNet32, it's not, they're different (apples and oranges) :P 
23:11:52diukas1
C# is like java 
23:12:24dipolaar
Ghassanpl cuz u have to look carefully in the class def. anyway maybe it's just me 
23:13:13
c++ with "modules" and a couple of minor things and it's the best language by far 
23:14:20ghassanpl
I'd argue there is no "best" language :) 
23:14:23
It all depends on what you need 
23:14:43dipolaar
right 
23:16:56diukas1
press continue in visualstudio 
23:17:56diukas1
im good just chillin in bed with lapop Keepo 
23:18:20
been working outside allday almost broke my leg it got stuck between heavy metals 
23:20:09diukas1
been practising SSE2 SIMD instructions its going  quite well 
23:22:15ghassanpl
As far as I know it usually does pretty well with converting to SSE 
23:22:28
But you have to specify that you want SSE2+ math in the project options 
23:24:48diukas1
well i was checking out some handmade game videos about simd and he was compilng stuff with gcc but it didnt optimise too well explicit write out of operations made rendering routine from 250 
23:24:57
250+cycles to 50~ 
23:26:12diukas1
yes that guy but he using emacs for code and vs for debugging 
23:29:31bobthescv
GCC is surprisingly bad at optimizing data copying (like memcpy) even with -march=native (at least on sandy bridge). 
23:29:50diukas1
myself i use visual studio when i steam but offline i use vim SSSsss 
23:31:33diukas1
u can install vsvim to enable all keybinds and modes in visual studio 
23:31:55dipolaar
swap with the last element> 
23:31:56
? 
23:35:00diukas1
the more i look at you u resemble my bachelor study SE lecturer SSSsss 
23:35:50
in lithuania Keepo 
23:36:07dipolaar
kinda makes me want to start coding again 
23:37:00bobthescv
Ah, here it is. I was digging into why the heck compilers take significantly longer time passing by value if the argument is bigger than 128 bytes, but part of that, I also found that GCC is about an order of magnitude slower at copying data than CLang: http://imgur.com/b1XIw5L 
23:38:17ghassanpl
As far as I know in the most common calling convention the first 2 arguments in registers, and the rest on the stack, so maybe that's it? :P 
23:38:48
are passed in registers* 
23:39:38bobthescv
Nope, it turns out after 128 bytes, it starts populating the stack with a  "rep movsq" call rather than doing an unrolled memory-register-memory copy. CLang seems to be able to vectorize it, but GCC doesn't. 
23:39:58
Was really confused there 
23:39:59ghassanpl
Oh, bytes, I read bits 
23:40:13bobthescv
Audio is alright 
23:40:15ghassanpl
Audio is fine 
23:40:40
Honestly, your accent is more of a problem than the audio, no offense :P 
23:40:53diukas1
you should ask for gameobject refrence not a copy SSSsss 
23:40:57bobthescv
I don't have any problem with the accent o_O 
23:41:00diukas1
this audio is fine for me 
23:41:39dipolaar
and not const probably 
23:43:55diukas1
i understand you perfectly SSSsss 
23:45:24diukas1
oh i see you upgraded to win10 aswell? 
23:45:39tili_us
wait how do you rename/refactor those methods? 
23:45:43
is that some hotkey? 
23:45:58bobthescv
Keep two vectors of collision objects, and copy the living ones asynchronously during rendering maybe, then do std::swap and clear the old one? 
23:46:56tili_us
2015 ? ah ok 
23:47:26diukas1
i had 1 softlock like 2 days ago on win10 the explorer locked itself on load loop and didnt restart if i kill it and rerun it again : [ 
23:50:19diukas1
got like 30mins of battery life left BibleThump 
23:51:15ghassanpl
I always give objects like bullets max life 
23:51:40
It ensures that they ALWAYS die 
23:52:04
Otherwise when I add things like gravity wells and the bullets spiral, there might be problems :P 
23:53:02
Are you 100% 1000% percent sure of that? I never trust myself when I think "I'm never gonna do X" 
23:53:04
:P 
23:55:09diukas1
okey bye gonna go sleep 
00:04:26bobthescv
Not stable_sort ? 
00:04:41
Although I guess therea re no duplicatse 
00:04:45
so it doesn't matter 
00:05:54bobthescv
binary search just returns a boolean I think 
00:06:56mrkillius24
hi 
00:08:56bobthescv
I think that gun is mildly overpowered 
00:09:03
;-) 
00:09:29dipolaar
stupid question but how do you work with git (github) on windows? command line too? 
00:09:56
or one uses the github app? 
00:10:30
alright. thx 
00:11:17ghassanpl
@Phildunstan, can you explain to me why everybody in game dev uses either perforce or git for code, and no one has even head of mercurial, which is as good if not better than git and leagues ahead of perforce 
00:11:20
heard* 
00:11:40dipolaar
reason: github 
00:11:49bobthescv
Do people use mercurial outside of the linux kernel guys? 
00:12:04dipolaar
linux kernel is git 
00:12:08bobthescv
It is? 
00:12:11
Hm 
00:12:14ghassanpl
dipolaar, mercurial has bitbucket 
00:12:44dipolaar
yes but the hype is on github 
00:12:53bobthescv
I use git but not github 
00:13:00dipolaar
its like facebook vs google+ lol 
00:13:00bobthescv
Mainly because I know how to use it 
00:13:07ghassanpl
Ugh 
00:13:33
Almost everyone I talk to agrees that mercurial is better than perforce and as good if not better than git, and yet nobody uses it :\ 
00:13:46
@Phildunstan, text rendering? that's always a doozy ;) 
00:15:06ghassanpl
@Phildunstan, can you tell us what you guys use at Ubi? 
00:15:52dipolaar
i guess people are switching to git 
00:17:04ghassanpl
Stupid perforce 
00:17:15
Perforce sucks donkey balls when it comes to code 
00:18:58bobthescv
Throttle the fire rate of the gun a bit maybe? 
00:19:03dipolaar
make a Credits section with all our names 
00:19:08
lmao 
00:19:14bobthescv
Like old school asteroids mode with a finite amout of bullets on screen? 
00:23:48wsgwshlbgg
Hi 
00:26:12dipolaar
decltype 
00:26:53bobthescv
Yea 
00:30:08ghassanpl
@Phildunstan, this might be a personal question, but have you ever struggled with programmer burnout? If so, how did you handle it? 
00:30:32dipolaar
commited murder 
00:30:35
:D 
00:35:18ghassanpl
I'm gonna have a job with Perforce, which I hate with a fiery passion, and working on other people's code, which I loathe... I don't think I've chosen wisely 
00:37:22bobthescv
I do game programming in my spare time because what I do at work is so uninteresting it's slowly killing my passion for programming :-/ 
00:37:58dipolaar
shouldnt the caller of FireBullet set the time? 
00:38:17
check then set

Hello :) 
22:40:47virdari
hey phil, have you ever done anything using machine learning algs ? 
22:46:22virdari
just graduated, from uni of liverpool, did my dissertation on negamax, and improvement techniques over it on a board game. I'm interested in the market, you know how things are for an AI programmer, I'm at the beginning of the road and need to decide what to pursue, would appreciate any advice since you have plenty of experience in this field :). Just started looking up deep learning, I wanna play around with it a little more to be able to differentiate people based on their profile picture :) 
23:01:55talyzeni
Hello, I am good. How are you? 
23:02:10ghassanpl
I'm having a pretty crappy last few days so I'm trying to stay quiet 
23:02:20razi3ll
not good ... tomorrow is monday 
23:02:29ghassanpl
I've been known to be abrasive when stressed 
23:03:18
Pretty much the new job 
23:03:32
And I'm broke at the moment so I can't eat over the stress 
23:04:56ghassanpl
I hope so 
23:04:59
Thanks 
23:05:55
BTW wouldn't it be better to use std::any_of instead of accumulate to check for alive aliens? 
23:18:05dipolaar
delta time is too short? 
23:24:00ghassanpl
Argh god damn the vector<bool> ! 
23:24:13
Grargh I'm really not in the mood for bad stuff right now :( 
23:25:05
I need to have a vector of bools because I need to take pointers to the bools 
23:28:13dipolaar
u do the entity/component style? 
23:28:52craftplorer
Is this VS2013? 
23:30:47dipolaar
linear data friendly design is the future 
23:31:10talyzeni
I have basic knowledge of C++. But I struggle to create a basic game. do you have any tips or know any useful tutorials that would help? 
23:31:42dipolaar
Talyzeni : use sfml 
23:31:59phildunstan
or libcinder 
23:34:33dipolaar
for entity sys u have to build a very flexible and robust array container with easy lookup and insert/remove specs 
23:38:46dipolaar
start with the "entity" class :D 
23:39:08devtron3d
did you not say small game ? 
23:40:04dipolaar
dont be afraid of template 
23:40:20devtron3d
did not have the windows at full screen saw the solutions explore, and thought that was all the game source code files :\ 
23:42:04dipolaar
yeah i saw lots of his talk. brilliant guy 
23:47:28dipolaar
it wont work 
23:47:48
yes u have to make it known at compile time 
23:48:48craftplorer
Which talk are you talking about? 
23:49:14ghassanpl
I was away for a while, what's new? 
23:49:15phildunstan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIhUE5uUFOA 
23:49:41craftplorer
thank you 
23:57:15dipolaar
dont forget to inherit from aimodelbase 
23:58:34dipolaar
m_game... 
23:58:40
ok 
00:00:47dipolaar
use the old style object init 
00:02:57dipolaar
did u try GameObject player(blah); 
00:03:04
the good old style 
00:05:45dipolaar
i am wondering, since its only a templated ctor, the template arg must be implicit 
00:05:59
ie, it wont work as expected 
00:10:11dipolaar
lest use a union in gameobject class 
00:10:36
you wont have that many aimodel 
00:15:47talyzeni
Haha amazing when you having fun you forgot what time it is... didn't you say, you wasn't going longer than 12 lol 
00:15:58
forget*

I now have a first world problem that more than one of my favorite twitch streamers is streaming at the same time :( 
22:37:17
It was fine the first time 
22:37:20
Oh, now it's okay 
22:38:33villimin
hy 
22:42:08ghassanpl
Oh, as a gamedev streamer? You're the best AFAIK :P whilke is also good, and stoneharth actually work on a commercial games and stream as a studio 
22:42:25
I was watching theycallhimben before you showed up, he paints Warhammer figurines :P I like small, relaxing streamers 
22:42:44
stonehearth* 
22:44:10ghassanpl
I don't like watching Unity, I'm mad at Unity for takin our jurbs 
22:47:42ghassanpl
I much prefer programming ones, but you're pretty much the only person who writes high quality C++ code :P 
22:48:34
It's better than 90% of what's out there :P 
22:51:58talyzeni
Hello :) 
22:52:13ghassanpl
I'm writing my own code right now too, I like working "in parallel" with someone, and this is a good facsimile of that :P

u work for ubi, omg cool! 
23:05:40zabitamemuru
omg The division ai programmer :d, i am also study computer engineering, who want to be a game programmer 
23:06:09satheinin
im learning c# and found the game dev in twitch looks interesting 
23:08:51satheinin
im new in to this what is better for game dev c# of c++ 
23:10:25zabitamemuru
u use snowdrop engine at work right? 
23:10:39talyzeni
gamebryo another game engine. I have used that before in uni 
23:15:50satheinin
im not rly trying to become a game dev but i do find it interesting 
23:28:56wsgwshlbgg
Hey 
23:30:44pherousa
I have no clue what's going on but it looks amazing Kappa 
23:31:43talyzeni
I know this is very personal. But income within the gaming industry is it any good? I've been told loads that you have to be really high up i.e. manager level before it gets worthwhile 
23:32:28julije34
hi 
23:33:36talyzeni
I guess it's the passion that makes it worthwhile :) 
23:33:46
I bet you have a smile on your face when you go to work. 
23:34:16julije34
what is better c# or c++ 
23:34:55talyzeni
He cannot really answer that question. depends on what you want to use the language for 
23:36:25satheinin
Im trying to become a software dev is the pay 
23:36:33
good 
23:36:58talyzeni
I gotta admit your website is like the best one I've seen :) love the design lol :) 
23:37:10satheinin
bulgaria 
23:38:49pherousa
What is easier to learn? C++ or C# 
23:38:54satheinin
i hear that there is a huge demand here for good devs is that a nessesary better pay 
23:38:57
c# 
23:39:35talyzeni
You're AI programmer... What was the most difficult algorithm  you had to implement  into a game? and Why? 
23:39:39satheinin
my opinion 
23:39:43nonsensation
wow, your HP is awesome, no doubts 
23:42:05pherousa
ok thanks, gonna learn C# 
23:42:47talyzeni
I had to do A* path searching before in uni. I thought that was so confusing lol 
23:45:55talyzeni
You going anywhere nice in the 2 weeks. or just having a break from streaming :) 
23:47:16talyzeni
Very nice. So the gaming business does pay well ;)

You have 2 weeks to think of one lol 
23:59:31talyzeni
When you are back. Will you carry on with this game? 
00:00:53wsgwshlbgg
I go off bye :)

Hello hello 
21:04:02
I am coding a game right now also 
21:04:54
So much buffering... Stupid european twitch servers 
21:06:32ghassanpl
Nah, I think twitch just doesn't like europe 
21:07:11
Maybe set a higher interval? It's coding, it doesn't need a lot 
21:07:22
iframe* interval 
21:10:40sp0nji
Yeah, not sure why but I also have lots of buffering on this channel 
21:10:54
feels like it's twitch's fault though 
21:16:25metal_pole1234
hello 
21:19:20portalprogramming
Are you using obs? 
21:21:50portalprogramming
How are you streaming? Using OBS, xSplit? 
21:22:35
Can you set your audio to mono? The right hear is a bit higher than the left one 
21:24:01portalprogramming
That's better! :) 
21:24:10ghassanpl
Much better 
21:24:16portalprogramming
Also, lower you bitrate or something. It keeps buffering. Twitch doesn't like streamer with low viewers. 
21:24:23
I have 1080p but 10 fps 
21:24:39
2000 bitrate 
21:24:52ghassanpl
Audio, it's buffering a lot less now, it's perfectly watchable for me 
21:25:00portalprogramming
The stream is buffering quite bit 
21:25:02ghassanpl
... and just right as I said that it buffered :P

21:25:10buhb11
I can't believe people actually code game logic inside C++ 
21:25:26ghassanpl
buhb11, it's a small game 
21:25:33buhb11
does not matter. 
21:25:40ghassanpl
How so? 
21:25:49portalprogramming
(pixel width * pixel height * frames-per-second * desired fidelity) / 1,000 
21:25:54buhb11
I find it painful! 
21:25:55portalprogramming
fidelity is 0.1 
21:26:04
2000 should be good for 1080p and 10 fps 
21:27:33buhb11
I'm doing myself a game framework inside c++ and opengl but all the logic of game will be inside lua. 
21:27:55
Phildunstan unity sucks *** :) 
21:28:01
if you're a game programmer not developer 
21:28:19portalprogramming
Lower lever is more fun! 
21:28:23
But thougher 
21:28:54buhb11
If I could make illegal unity I would.(okay I'll shut up) 
21:28:59portalprogramming
I had a bug for my rendering engine (FBO). Tried to find the bug for like 2 months, never found it :( 
21:29:53ghassanpl
I hated on unity until I started working with code for a AAA game written entirely in C++ 
21:29:55buhb11
It gives all this 'power' to everyone without needing to learn that much about _how_ a game actually works from bottom to top. 
21:29:59ghassanpl
By the japanese 
21:30:18
And I think I'd prefer a game written in Unity, at least it's a lot less code to *** up :\ 
21:31:16buhb11
write a game engine inside C++ and add C# or lua as scripting lang. 
21:31:31portalprogramming
Du kommer ju från Sverige :)

Hello 
22:32:04
No sound? 
22:32:08
Oh 
22:32:15
Now there's sound 
22:32:32
Tired after a week of porting crappy japanese code :P 
22:33:38ghassanpl
Not allowed, it's a fighting game based on a pre-existing US property 
22:37:25ghassanpl
Which part of your code would you say is the most interesting or you are most proud of? 
22:37:37
I want to read it :) 
22:41:36ghassanpl
Hey, compared to the code I'm dealing with at my job, your code is like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel :P 
22:46:52ghassanpl
Is everything okay, there's a lot of thumping in the background 
22:50:38haapmusic
c++ mindful meditation moments, with Phil. 
22:52:13ghassanpl
Have you thought of maybe adding a debug/tweak GUI, like AntTweakBar or imgui? Or is it too complex for a simple project like this? 
22:54:50ghassanpl
imgui is very unintrusive (imho) but it's kind of a pain to integrate (you need your own functions to render their draw lists) 
22:55:22
AntTweakBar is much simpler to hoop up,but it's a bit older and more intrusive 
23:18:39ghassanpl
Can you say whether you guys at your work use STL at all? 
23:20:22ghassanpl
Right, typical gamedev high-performance engine stuff 
23:21:34ghassanpl
Yeah, I used EASTL, it was pretty awesome 
23:29:27ghassanpl
Yay, credits 
23:29:31
Thanks for streaming 
23:30:29cypryss

Good evening :) How are you doing? 
20:31:04zabitamemuru
hey, there is no voice 
20:31:26nonsensation
I can hear him pretty well 
20:31:44zabitamemuru
i should refresh the page 
20:32:07
oo ok now D: 
20:34:07nonsensation
:) 
20:37:44azenris
TweakaableAutpoRegister defined where 
20:45:39nonsensation
what are those pink fields on the left and right side of the code editor? is it an addin or comes with the free version of visual studio? and what does it do? looks kind of a profiler result 
20:45:58azenris
source control i think 
20:46:16
o 
21:01:17furygames_
is there any free programs out there for game development sorry new to this 
21:02:16zabitamemuru
try unity3d 
21:04:44phildunstan
unity3d (c# or javascript), pygame (python), libcinder (c++), sfml (c++) 
21:06:05zabitamemuru
or try html5 canvas, javascript

22:02:37nonsensation
Hey, how r u doing? 
22:03:59nonsensation
Sounds good :) im just chilling right now with yours stream and some nachos :D 
22:08:26nonsensation
what vcs do you use? tfs or git? 
22:10:16nonsensation
Yeah, i also prefer bitbucket for personal projects, although i use github for open source stuff, as its more popular 
22:15:39hengad
why do you use e.g. 10.0f instead of just 10? i am learning c++ and i know only basic stuff 
22:17:27hengad
oh that majes more sense but why not just use int :P 
22:17:36
makes* 
22:28:49hengad
wowowow what? that blew my mind, how can you type to 2 lines same time? 
22:29:46
dayym, that's nice 
22:30:49finesem8
What language is this? DansGame 
22:30:51nonsensation
Sublime text's multiple cursor is even more powerfull (supports autocompletion and like real cursors on every line) i kind of miss it in vidual studio 
22:30:55
c++ 
22:31:01finesem8
Aight 
22:31:26
Sublime is awesome! 
22:31:37
You should try it out if you havn't 
22:32:05nonsensation
but sulime lacks support for c++ plugins 
22:32:42finesem8
Yes there are downsides ofcoarse, but for html javascript php css it's the best I think :) 
22:32:59nonsensation
yeah, true 
22:43:45finesem8
Hey, what game are you building there by the way @phildunstan ? FunRun 
22:44:34
Ah okey, seems nice :) 
22:47:45owen144576
you're bloody clever 
22:47:47
m8 
22:50:12owen144576
what kind of game is it 
22:51:18ghassanpl
Oh, haven't noticed you're streaming 
22:54:17ghassanpl
Hey Phil, quick question 
22:54:25
What's your opinion on multiple results - tie() vs returning via argument references? 
22:55:51owen144576
omg this is scary 
22:56:14ghassanpl
Scary? How so? 
22:56:49owen144576
cuz i do not obtain the intellegence to understand what is going on here 
22:56:59finesem8
lol 
22:57:00owen144576
i 
22:57:17ghassanpl
It's just experience 
22:57:27
With enough knowledge and experience it becomes simple 
22:57:30nonsensation
i'd go without tie(), as i prefer ''A better C-style'' for my c++, but if the surrounding code is already heavyweight c++, id also go with tie 
22:58:05ghassanpl
@nonsensation, What do you mean by "heavyweight" C++? 
22:58:56nonsensation
i mean, when std::tie isnt the hardest part on understanding the code :D 
22:59:53
when you already work with tuples in other code or the function, why not using tie? but a tie alone is confusing i think 
23:01:58owen144576
what years or depending on if you're a fast learner 
23:02:17
to see it as "simple" 
23:02:24ghassanpl
I've been debugging all day, this is making my brain sore again :P 
23:03:06nonsensation
@Ghassanpl :P 
23:03:19ghassanpl
Owen144576, well, I've been writing code for the past 20 years, since I was 8-9, so there's that 
23:03:31owen144576
oh wow 
23:04:20ghassanpl
But you can learn to be a great coder in 5 years 
23:04:34owen144576
the only type of programming i've encountered is on turbo pascal :) 
23:07:14nonsensation
@Phildunstan is the tiny time elapsed from the profiler a plugin or comes with visual studio by default? 
23:08:29nonsensation
nice nice 
23:12:28diukas1
omeiged i see myself in credits Keepo 
23:12:34nonsensation

Hello 
21:14:06monsieurempereur
Hello, how have you been? 
21:17:43monsieurempereur
I've been working for the last month or so, I couldn't watch streams as much. 
21:17:47
:( 
21:19:34nonsensation
Hey, how are you doing? :) 
21:23:02monsieurempereur
is it possible to create a real time business desktop app in c++? 
21:24:13ghassanpl
You can do anything in C++! It's like zombo.com that way 
21:25:16dylamsamuel
haha I see what you did there GhassanPL 
21:29:06hengad
Could you show your main function? 
21:29:32cryptdos
is it anything to do with line ((facing.y < 0 && (position.y > minWorld.y)) || were you meant to change the second > to a < ? 
21:33:18hengad
If you have so many files, how can your main be that simple :o 
21:37:40hengad
how did you learn game programming? by yourself or did you have education? 
21:40:00nonsensation
have you changed ur stream settings? or is it my lame ingternet? i cannot watch 10secs straight today. its probably my connection :\ 
21:40:25hengad
for me its okay 
21:41:02
it's your network nonsensation 
21:41:34nonsensation
no, dont change anything, its our shitty www :\ argh 
21:42:03
@Hengad unfortunately ^^, 
21:43:27icemanvincy85
Hi, i learn c and c++ at school, i started to develop in c#, but c++ is so complicated :) 
21:44:34hengad
@Phildunstan if i have learned pointers and templates, is there something even harder? 
21:44:40
For me c++ have been simple 
21:45:07icemanvincy85
i start with Unity and c#, video tutorial helps me a little :) but i'm just a rookie for now...i hope to improve when i grow up ;) 
21:45:27nonsensation
@Hengad do you know expression templates :D look at the boost hana source or similar, this is nuts 
21:48:56icemanvincy85
never seen the assert :) 
21:51:28icemanvincy85
you never use comments, you remember every function you make? Impressive 
21:52:12zekangaroo
I'm just starting with C# myself looking forward to C++ 
21:53:15icemanvincy85
with Unity and c# you could make great game, C++ is more professional 
21:54:22jnix002
hello! 
21:54:23ghassanpl
If you just want to make games, I'd recommend C# and Unity, if you're passionate about programming, try C++ 
21:55:24icemanvincy85
i just complete the Roll a ball tutorial of Unity, simply game...but i'm just playing to change color, and make other things...i made also the Space shooter...before the stealth game i wanna improve better 
21:55:30ghassanpl
Making games at the AAA level is difficult and often unrewarding work 
21:57:28mickymaven
i might learn something on this stream :) 
21:57:44
hope you get something from your game :) 
21:58:01ghassanpl
@Phildunstan, in situations like these I'd forgo an implicit range in favor of an explicit one 
21:59:03nonsensation
Hey @ Mickymaven

22:00:47icemanvincy85
i hate when i can't fix the errors ahah 
22:04:11ghassanpl
Ugh I hate dealing with floats for this very reason 
22:05:11ragathian
Ghassanpl, if you need to do an equals comparison with floats you're usually doing something wrong(or writing unit tests as in this case) 
22:05:31ghassanpl
Ragathian, I know 
22:05:45nonsensation
@Ragathian also on == 0.0? 
22:06:30ukropas
what kind of graphics API is he using? 
22:06:41ragathian
Nonsensation, that depends, if its to avoid a division by 0, its probably a valid use of it 
22:06:45ghassanpl
OpenGL on top of SDL 
22:06:45nonsensation
Opengl + SDL+ Glew 
22:10:06ukropas
Have a nice and productive day : ) 
22:10:12icemanvincy85
who is outside and trying to enter should hit the wall and destroy, no? 
22:10:15ghassanpl
Well if the player cannot kill the monsters outside the world and they move randomly, there's no guarantee the player will ever win :P 
22:11:36norka98
Im trying to get into progaming, i would like to get into java, i have some basic knoweledge, what would u suggest i do to start with java ? 
22:12:11ragathian
Norka98, download an IDE and go through a few tutorials 
22:12:39icemanvincy85
Java is more complicated than c# for me, easier than c++. C# to start i guess, than java and C++ 
22:12:44norka98
i have been searching but most tutorials are 2011 ish ( free or pirated ) , doest that even matter ' 
22:13:55norka98
Thx alot :)

22:14:57ragathian
Icemanvincy85, i wouldnt say java is more complicated than C#, but the .net toolchain is definitely a lot better 
22:15:24norka98
Thx alot @Phildunstan
